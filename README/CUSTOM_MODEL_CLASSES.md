# Custom Model Classes Configuration

## âœ… Configuration Complete!

Your custom trained models have been successfully integrated with **smart class detection**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Custom Vehicle Detection Model

**File**: `models/vehical/best.pt` and `last.pt`

### Detected Classes:
- **Class 0**: `body` - Vehicle body
- **Class 1**: `window` - Vehicle windows
- **Class 2**: `wheel` - Vehicle wheels

### Why This is BRILLIANT:
Instead of detecting whole vehicles, your model detects **vehicle parts**! This gives much more detailed submersion analysis:
- âœ… See which specific parts are underwater
- âœ… **Wheels underwater** â†’ Partially submerged
- âœ… **Body underwater** â†’ Fully submerged
- âœ… **Window underwater** â†’ Fully submerged

---

## ðŸŒŠ Your Custom Flood Segmentation Model

**File**: `models/flood/best.pt` and `last.pt`

### Detected Classes:
- **Class 0**: `water` - Water/flood regions

### Why This is PERFECT:
Your model is specifically trained to identify water/flood regions, making it ideal for:
- âœ… Accurate water detection in flood scenarios
- âœ… Better than generic segmentation models
- âœ… Optimized for your specific use case

---

## ðŸ”„ How the System Works

### Automatic Model Detection

The system **automatically detects** which type of model you're using:

```python
# When you load a model, it checks the class names:

If model has classes ['body', 'window', 'wheel']:
    â†’ Custom vehicle parts model detected
    â†’ Use part-based submersion analysis

If model has classes ['car', 'truck', 'bus', ...]:
    â†’ COCO model detected
    â†’ Use whole-vehicle submersion analysis

If model has class ['water']:
    â†’ Custom water model detected
    â†’ Accurate water segmentation
```

**You don't need to configure anything** - it's automatic!

## ðŸ“Š Part-Based Submersion Analysis

### How Parts Are Analyzed:

```
Detection:   [body] [window] [wheel] [wheel]
              â†“        â†“       â†“       â†“
Water Check: 80%     90%     100%    100%
              â†“        â†“       â†“       â†“
Result:      FULL    FULL    PARTIAL PARTIAL
```

### Submersion Rules for Custom Model:

#### ðŸ”´ Wheel (Most Sensitive):
- **â‰¥50% underwater** â†’ Partially Submerged
- **<50% underwater** â†’ Not Submerged

#### ðŸŸ  Body:
- **â‰¥70% underwater** â†’ Fully Submerged
- **30-70% underwater** â†’ Partially Submerged
- **<30% underwater** â†’ Not Submerged

#### ðŸŸ  Window:
- **â‰¥70% underwater** â†’ Fully Submerged
- **30-70% underwater** â†’ Partially Submerged
- **<30% underwater** â†’ Not Submerged

### Why These Thresholds?
- **Wheels are most sensitive**: If wheels are underwater, the vehicle is already in trouble
- **Body is critical**: Body underwater means vehicle is deeply submerged
- **Window is severe**: Window underwater means near-complete submersion

## ðŸ”€ Comparison: Custom vs COCO Models

### Custom Model (Your Models):
```
Input Image
    â†“
Detection: body, window, wheel, wheel
    â†“
Segmentation: water regions
    â†“
Analysis: Which PARTS are underwater?
    - wheel 100% underwater â†’ PARTIAL
    - body 80% underwater â†’ FULL
    â†“
Result: Detailed part-level analysis
```

### COCO Model (Official YOLO):
```
Input Image
    â†“
Detection: car, truck, bus
    â†“
Segmentation: various objects
    â†“
Analysis: Is whole VEHICLE underwater?
    - car 60% underwater â†’ PARTIAL
    â†“
Result: General vehicle-level analysis
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Visualization

### Custom Model Visualization:

When using your custom models, the UI shows:
- **Boxes around vehicle parts** (body, window, wheel)
- **Color-coded by submersion level**:
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Fully submerged part
  - ðŸŸ  Orange: Partially submerged part
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Not submerged part
- **Blue overlay for water regions**
- **Labels showing**: `"wheel: 0.95 - Partially Submerged (100%)"`

### Statistics Display:

```
Total Vehicles: 3 (estimated from body parts)
Total Parts Detected: 12
Fully Submerged: 2
Partially Submerged: 8
Not Submerged: 2
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Configuration

### Run the inspection script:

```bash
inspect_models.bat
```

**This will show:**
- Model type (detection / segmentation)
- Class names detected
- Number of classes
- Whether custom model is recognized

### Run the test script:

```bash
test_custom.bat
```

**This will test:**
- Custom model loading
- Part detection
- Water segmentation
- Submersion analysis
- Integration between modules

---

## ðŸš€ Using Your Models

### In the Application:

1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   run.bat
   ```

2. **Select your models** (they appear at the top):
   - Detection: `ðŸŽ¯ Vehicle Custom (Best)`
   - Segmentation: `ðŸŒŠ Flood Custom (Best)`

3. **Upload a test image** with flooded vehicles

4. **See the magic**:
   - System auto-detects it's using custom models
   - Analyzes vehicle parts individually
   - Shows which parts are underwater
   - Color-codes by submersion severity

### Expected Output:

```
âœ… Loaded CUSTOM vehicle parts model: models/vehical/best.pt
   Classes: ['body', 'window', 'wheel']

âœ… Loaded CUSTOM water segmentation model: models/flood/best.pt
   Classes: ['water']

Processing image...
Detected 12 parts: 4 body, 4 window, 4 wheel
Estimated 4 vehicles

Submersion Analysis:
- 3 wheels partially submerged (50-100%)
- 2 bodies fully submerged (>70%)
- 1 window fully submerged (>70%)
```

   - Body underwater: Severe damage
   - Window underwater: Total loss

3. **Flexible Thresholds**:
   - Different parts have different sensitivity
   - More accurate submersion classification

4. **Real-World Application**:
   - Insurance assessment
   - Rescue priority
   - Damage estimation

## ðŸŽ¯ For Your Demo (October 28th)

### Key Points to Highlight:

1. **Smart Model Detection**:
   - "The system automatically detects whether it's using custom or standard models"

2. **Part-Level Analysis**:
   - "Unlike standard detection, we analyze individual vehicle parts"
   - "This gives more accurate submersion assessment"

3. **Intelligent Thresholds**:
   - "Wheels are most sensitive - any submersion is concerning"
   - "Body submersion indicates severe flooding"

4. **Custom Training**:
   - "These models were specifically trained on flood scenarios"
   - "More accurate than generic YOLO models"

5. **Comparison**:
   - Show same image with custom vs COCO models
   - Demonstrate superior detail from part-based detection
